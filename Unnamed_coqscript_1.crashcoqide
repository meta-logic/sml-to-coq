Local Axiom patternFailure:forall{a},a.

Inductive Tree {_a : Type} :=
  | Empty
  | Leaf : _a -> @Tree _a
  | Node : (Tree * Tree) -> Tree.


Definition x := match (Leaf 1) with 
            | Leaf x => x 
            | _ => patternFailure end.

Definition a := let  '(m,n) := (1,2) in m.
Compute x.

Definition y := 1.

Theorem x_is_1 : x = y.
Proof. unfold x.
